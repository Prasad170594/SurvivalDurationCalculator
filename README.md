Description

This project is designed to determine how long an individual has lived by converting their age into various time units such as Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds. The user enters their age and selects a preferred time unit, and the application outputs the corresponding duration.

Design
1.	A class named ‘AgeConverter’ was created to handle the conversion calculations which also includes methods for converting age into different time units.
2.	A method was also developed to process user input and perform the required conversion.
3.	The program is designed to run smoothly without errors, providing accurate results based on the user's input.

Usage
1.	Run the Script: Execute the script ‘Survival_Duration_Calculator.ipynb’.  
2.	Input Age: When prompted, enter your age in years.
3.	Select Time Unit: Choose the desired time unit by typing its name (months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds) or the first letter of the unit.
4.	View Result: The application will display how long you have lived in the selected time unit.

Process
1.	Class Definition: Created a class named ‘AgeConverter’ to handle all conversion calculations.
2.	Method Implementation: Implemented methods for converting age into different time units.
3.	Input Handling: Developed a method to process user input and perform the required conversion.
4.	Execution: Ensured that the application runs smoothly without errors and provides accurate results based on the user's input.
